# postdoc

Clojure library for documenting clojure programs in more details.
Key ideas are :
1) Add more detailed documentation, more suitable than just a doc String.
2) Expose both a CLI and a Web interface (like javadoc)
3) Expose documentation in separate namespace, thus file, making version control easier.
3) Innovative documentation materials : examples, exercises, several level of details, etc. Structured semantics;
